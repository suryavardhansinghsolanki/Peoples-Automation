## 🔐 First-Time Setup (OTP Login)

You only need to do this **once**.

### Step 1 — Run the script

```bash
python meeting_final.py
```

Chrome will open and navigate to the Peoplefirst portal.

### Step 2 — Login manually

Complete the login using your credentials and OTP verification.

### Step 3 — Close Chrome correctly

**Do NOT click the X button.** Always use this command:

```bash
taskkill /F /IM chrome.exe /T
```

This saves your session correctly so OTP is never asked again.

## ▶️ Running the Script

After first-time login, every future run is just:

```bash
python meeting_final.py
```

That's it. The script handles everything automatically.

## ⚡ How It Works (Technical Summary)

### Speed Optimizations

This script is built for **maximum speed**:

| Technique | What it does |
|---|---|
| `page_load_strategy = eager` | Doesn't wait for full page load — acts as soon as DOM is ready |
| `--blink-settings=imagesEnabled=false` | Skips all image downloads |
| JS injection | Clicks, inputs, events all done via JavaScript — no browser simulation delay |
| `js_poll()` | Polls DOM every 30–50ms instead of fixed `time.sleep()` waits |
| Combined XPath (`\|`) | Checks all button variants in one WebDriverWait call |
| Total fixed sleep | Only **0.20 seconds** of hardcoded sleep in entire script |

### Angular Component Handling

The portal uses Angular custom elements. The room card is structured as:

```
owl-item (carousel wrapper)
  └─ lib-room-card  ← Angular host (NO click handler)
       └─ div.rmcrd ← ACTUAL clickable element ✅
```

The script finds `div.rmcrd` and dispatches a full mouse event chain (`mouseenter → mouseover → mousedown → mouseup → click`) — exactly like a real user click.

### React Input Handling

Standard `send_keys()` doesn't work on React-controlled inputs. The script uses JavaScript's native `HTMLInputElement` setter to bypass React's synthetic event system.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| OTP asked again | Chrome was closed using X button | Run script → login again → `taskkill /F /IM chrome.exe /T` |
| `SessionNotCreatedException` | ChromeDriver version mismatch | Download ChromeDriver matching your Chrome version from [chromedriver.chromium.org](https://chromedriver.chromium.org) |
| Portal loads but hangs | Network slow / portal down | Wait and retry. Script timeouts are set to handle slow AJAX |
| Room not found | Room No 02 not available on that date/time | Manually check portal availability |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: selenium` | Selenium not installed | `pip install selenium` |
| Script runs but no booking | T&C modal button text changed | Check console output for button debug info |

---

## ⚠️ Important Rules

### ✅ Always close Chrome like this:

```bash
taskkill /F /IM chrome.exe /T
```

### ❌ Never close Chrome using the X button

Closing Chrome normally **may corrupt the session** and require OTP login again.

### ✅ Session Persistence

Your login session is stored at:

```
C:\Users\HP\Desktop\MyAutoProfile
```

As long as this folder exists and session is valid, the script runs **without any manual login**.

---

## 📌 Quick Reference

```bash
# Install
pip install selenium

# First time only
python meeting_final.py
# → Login with OTP manually
taskkill /F /IM chrome.exe /T

# Every run after that
python meeting_final.py
```
